# BHLms_NA
This repository is set to push all the codes produced in the context of my master thesis in Informations and Communication Sciences and Technologies at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium). The goal of this project is to analyse with the tools and methods of network analysis the dataset created from the database BHLms, a database taken the informations produced by the Bollandists about the hagiographic sources they found in the libraries of multiple countries of Europe during centuries. The database was created during the last decade of the XXth at the Université de Namur with the historians Michel Trigalet and François De Vriendt with de collaboration of Paul Bertrand and Bénédicte Legrain under the direction of Prof. Guy Phillipart, and adapted and enriched by Robert Godding, Xavier Lequeux and Jean-Marie Delanghe (see here for the presentation of the project http://bhlms.fltr.ucl.ac.be/presentation.cfm)
